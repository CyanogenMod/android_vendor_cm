    <!-- Default for Settings.Secure.USER_SETUP_COMPLETE
         AOSP can setup this value to false because it can be assured that gapps are
         preinstalled in his devices, and SetupWizard can complete the user setup.
         CM cannot assure it. So we need the "user_setup_complete" in order to things
         working from the first steps (like QuickSettings or KeyguardSelector stuff).
